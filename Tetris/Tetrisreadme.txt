Tetris

Overview:

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using C++ and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game where players must manipulate falling tetrominoes (shapes composed of four square blocks) to create complete rows of blocks without any gaps. When a row is complete, it disappears, and the blocks above it shift down.

Features

Basic Gameplay: Control falling tetrominoes (Tetris blocks) using keyboard inputs (left, right, down, and up for rotation).
Scoring System: Score points for each completed row.
Level Progression: Increase game difficulty over time by speeding up the falling tetrominoes.
Simple Graphics: Rendered using SFML for graphics and window management.
